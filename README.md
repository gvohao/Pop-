For my first coding project, I decided to create a game built around the idea of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) used to determine a "player's" risk-taking behaviour.

Players are required to click on the "balloon" (which increases in size) to earn points and decide at which point they would like to stop "pumping" the balloon. Balloons will burst at a random number of pump, at which point the points collected will be lost. This deters players from clicking mindlessly to earn points while the objective of the game is to collect as many points through pumping 30 balloons throughout the course of the game.

The design of the game was heavily inspired by a course mate and was a good practice of CSS.
